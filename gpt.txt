Generate a data model, incorporating what data needs to be stored and how it needs to be linked as Django file.

At a high level here are all the entities that you have:

Users (of type either instructor or students)
Courses (instructors teach these and students take these)
Lectures (particular days for each course)
QR Codes (uploads that are associated with lectures and students)

ChatGPT:
To model the entities described (Users, Courses, Lectures, and QR Codes) and their relationships in Django, 
we'll create a set of models that define the data structure and the relationships between these entities. 
Below is an example of how you can set up these models in Django:

from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

# Custom User model to differentiate between instructors and students
class User(AbstractUser):
    USER_TYPE_CHOICES = (
        ('instructor', 'Instructor'),
        ('student', 'Student'),
    )
    user_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=USER_TYPE_CHOICES)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username

# Course model to represent courses taught by instructors
class Course(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    instructor = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='courses_taught')

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

# Lecture model to represent lectures scheduled for each course
class Lecture(models.Model):
    course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='lectures')
    date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.course.name} - Lecture on {self.date}'

# QRCode model to represent uploaded QR codes associated with lectures and students
class QRCode(models.Model):
    lecture = models.ForeignKey(Lecture, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='qr_codes')
    student = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='qr_codes_scanned')
    qr_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='qrcodes/')

    def __str__(self):
        return f'QR Code for {self.lecture} - Scanned by {self.student.username}'

In this Django model setup:

User Model:
Inherits from AbstractUser to provide basic user functionalities.
Includes a custom field user_type to differentiate between instructors and students.
The user_type field is a choice field with options for 'instructor' or 'student'.

Course Model:
Represents a course taught by an instructor.
Contains a foreign key instructor linking to the User model (instructor).

Lecture Model:
Represents a lecture scheduled for a specific course on a particular date.
Contains a foreign key course linking to the Course model.

QRCode Model:
Represents a QR code uploaded and associated with a specific lecture and student.
Contains foreign keys lecture and student linking to the Lecture and User models respectively.
Includes an qr_image field to upload the QR code image.

Usage and Querying Examples:
1. Creating a new Course:
instructor = User.objects.get(username='instructor1')
course = Course.objects.create(name='Introduction to Django', instructor=instructor)

2. Adding a Lecture to a Course:
course = Course.objects.get(name='Introduction to Django')
lecture = Lecture.objects.create(course=course, date='2024-04-10')

3. Uploading a QR Code for a Lecture:
lecture = Lecture.objects.get(course__name='Introduction to Django', date='2024-04-10')
student = User.objects.get(username='student1')
qr_code = QRCode.objects.create(lecture=lecture, student=student, qr_image='path_to_image.png')

4. Querying QR Codes Scanned by a Student:
student = User.objects.get(username='student1')
qr_codes_scanned = QRCode.objects.filter(student=student)

This Django model setup allows you to manage users (instructors and students), courses, lectures, and QR codes efficiently and 
query relationships between these entities as needed. Adjust the model fields and relationships based on your specific 
requirements and application logic.

Me:
We think that this data model seems a lot more simple and streamlined compared to our unique data model.
However, we think that ChatGPT lacks the information from the helper functions that we incorporated
within out unique data model which is more informative overall. We think at its core, ChatGPT's data
model is a lot more simpler and easier to implement at a higher level compared to ours, but it is less
informative from a documentation standpoint.
